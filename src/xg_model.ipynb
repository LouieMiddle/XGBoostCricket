    "The concept of \"Expected Goals\" (xG for short), is a widely used metric among soccer analysts and fans alike. In fact, the idea of xG has infiltrated the mainstream in recent years, to the point where now, even most casual fans have probably heard of the term. The xG metric essentially describes how many goals we'd expect a team to score based on the chances it creates. Each shot a team takes can be assigned an xG value, ranging from 0 to 1, which represents the probability of that shot resulting in a goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The xG metric helps provide objectivity in the analysis of a soccer match, since actual score lines can often be misleading given that luck plays such a large role in the game. If we can see that a team dominated a game by creating many more chances and generating a much larger xG than the other team, this tells us they were probably better on that day, regardless of what the final scoreline may say. Additionally, analyzing xG can help inform play styles, in terms of determining what type of shots are better to take to maximize the probability of scoring a goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook consists in a comprehensive overview of an xG model created using Statsbomb public data. More specifically, the model is creating using data from Barcelona's La Liga matches from 2004 to 2016."
