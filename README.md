# Expected Goals Model

This repository contains an Expected goals (xG) model I made using Logistic Regression.
The data used to train the model is from Barcelona matches spanning 2004/05 to 2015/16. The data is obtained from Statsbomb's [open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).

Note that this project is a work in progress.

The model itself is run in the jupyter notebook, xg_model.ipynb, in the src directory.
