# Expected Goals Model

## Original README

This repository contains an Expected goals (xG) model. Many classification methods are tested to see which one yields the best results, including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest and logistic regression. The data used to train the model is from Barcelona matches spanning 2004/05 to 2015/16. The data is obtained from Statsbomb's [open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).

Note that this project is a work in progress.

The model itself is run in the jupyter notebook, xg_model.ipynb, in the src directory.

## New README

This forked repository will be updated to predict runs from cricket data
