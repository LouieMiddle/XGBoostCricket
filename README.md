# xG model

This repository contains my xG model, based on Decision tree / Random forest classifiers. 
The data used to train the model is from Barcelona matches spanning 2004/05 to 2015/16. The data is obtained from Statsbomb's [open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data). 

The model itself is run in the jupyter notebook, xg_model.ipynb, in the src directory.
